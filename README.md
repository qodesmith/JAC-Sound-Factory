ALERT THUNDERCATS!! ALERT THUNDERCATS!!

The JAC SoundFactory is a composition medium that allows cyber-plebs to create music using a variety of sound libraries as instruments. Do you want to rehash Under Pressure using bathroom sounds? Is your life devoid of a barnyard animals-Katy Perry mashup? Is it Beethoven's 5th in lasers and explosions that you desire? Let JAC SoundFactory feed your exotic aural fetishes.
