ALERT THUNDERCATS!! ALERT THUNDERCATS!!

In response, the Thundercats have deployed to save the plebs by creating....drumroll....a sewper suite sownd seqwencer.

Is your life devoid of a barnyard animals-Katy Perry mashup? Is it Beethoven's 5th in lasers and explosions that you desire? Let JAC SoundFactory feed your exotic aural fetishes.
